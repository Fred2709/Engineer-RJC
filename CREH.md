I start working on the Project since November 18.
I just discuss idea about the project with Attuwalai Yamanga another C Programing Student on Tuesday night, However we never see each other project
One of the part that was difficult for me is to validate integer Input within range and string input to not  exceeds.
I did search on another site which is https://labex.io/tutorials/c-how-to-validate-input-in-c-programming-425511 and I follow the example provided.
I was questionning myself if all of my species should be in database.
I did talk to Attawalai about that. I was confuse about it.
I visited Jennifer Caramona to ask her to take a look over the project. She just show me how to write and save data in a file with the reference chapter workin with file however sher didn't touch my code to modify anything.
I did talk about that with Professor Michael Penta. He told me it's not required and I give up on it to not mess up the code in the last minute.
I had difficulty using the fgets I choose the scanf it gave me probleme also with space issue.
I also look on Geeks for geeks website to find help. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-and-output-in-c/
I did search on  this site and find the solution how to solve the space the space issue.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1247989/how-do-you-allow-spaces-to-be-entered-using-scanf
I did use continue in my funtions's validation of input which it a special keyword reserved in C language. It is mentioned in the chapter 2.
Overall, I feel proud to be able to write down this program even though it might not be perfect becaus ethis is coding and it's normal to make mistake. I will keep practicing during the winter break to get deeper in the language.

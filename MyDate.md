This is a basic one for beginner.
As I reviewing right now th C language I decide to rewrite a new version 
that I will allow you to compare with the old one.
I took time to do a readme doc also and comment each line

 Create a new program named MyDate.c. Copy or type in something like the
 "Hello, World" program and make sure you can compile and run it.
 b. Following the example in Section 2.5, write a program that creates variables
 named day, month and year What type is each variable?
 Assign values to those variables that represent today’s date.
 c. Print the value of each variable on a line by itself. This is an intermediate step
 that is useful for checking that everything is working so far.

 The point of this exercise is to use the output function printf to display values
 with different types, and to practice developing programs gradually by adding a few
 statements at a time.

 a. Create a new program called MyTime.c. From now on, I won’t remind you to
 start with a small, working program, but

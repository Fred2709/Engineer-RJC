Engineer-RJC

Hello everyone, I am Renefred Jean Charles

I started taking programimg classes a year ago and I've decide to revise all of my coding exercise and projects to refresh my knowledge and improve my skills. I am also open to new challenges as I'm committed to lifelong learning. 

The languages I work with are HTML/CSS, Java Script, C and Java
Here you will find my first projects in C.

Be patient there's more coming up !!!

My focus are data science and cybersecuirty.I choose those because I intend to dive into public policy. However, I don't limit myself because I am exploring Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and more. I enjoy diving into different fields as part of my growth.

I hope you will enjoy and learn from my code. I am willing to provide multiple versions of the same project, exercise and challenges to encourage critical thinking and demonstrate different problem-solving approches
